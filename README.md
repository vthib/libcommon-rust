# serde-iop

Library implementing the IOP binary packing/unpacking for
[serde](https://serde.rs/).

For a description of IOP, see documentation of the
[lib-common](https://github.com/Intersec/lib-common) library, as well
as the more in-depth documentation of the
[IOP format](https://intersec.github.io/lib-common/lib-common/iop/base.html)

This is a work-in-progress, and not ready to use yet.
